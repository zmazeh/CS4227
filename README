END RESULT
- Have a 4 way intersection of cars getting from point A to point B
  - point A can start anywhere
  - point B can end anywhere but not on the same road on that side of the intersection (aka. NO U TURNS)
    Example:
            v   ^
        ___|  |  |___
    <-  ___       ___ <-    
     -> ___       ___ ->
           |  |  |
            v   ^
  
- This is a basic simulation so there are 2 lanes on each road
  - each go in opposite directions (EXAMPLE ABOVE)
- traffic lights are random following basic rules
- cars follow lights rules
